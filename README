st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.

Local changes (this fork)
-------------------------
- Retro defaults: PxPlus IBM VGA8 font with antialias enabled for crisp VGA-style glyphs.
- Modus tinted palettes: dark (Vivendi) and light (Operandi) hardcoded in config.h.
  Main inspiration: https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes
- Quick light/dark toggle for projection use (Alt+F5).
- Per-theme transparency with a smaller focus/unfocus delta.
- Dedicated selection colors with alpha-aware selection background.
- Palette-index friendly: prompts using ANSI color indices adapt automatically to the current theme.

Example: quick light/dark toggle (Alt+F5)
    /* config.h */
    { MODKEY,               XK_F5,          theme,          {.i = -1} },

Example: per-theme alpha controls (tune for your display)
    /* config.h */
    static double alphaDark = 0.93;
    static double alphaUnfocusedDark = 0.90;
    static double alphaLight = 0.05;
    static double alphaUnfocusedLight = 0.03;
